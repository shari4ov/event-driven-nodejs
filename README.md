# event-driven-nodejs

Explore the power of event-driven architecture in Node.js with this simple CLI ticket project, leveraging the robust EventEmitter class.

# How It Works:
1. **Event Emission and Listening**: Node.js's EventEmitter class allows seamless event emission and listening.

2. **Server-Client Interaction**: The server extends the EventEmitter class, accepting the client object as a parameter in its constructor. Clients utilize the `on` function, where the first parameter signifies the event name, and the second parameter holds the callback function.

3. **Transmission of Events**: Clients transmit events to the server component using the `emit` function. The event name specifies the type of event, while the associated data ensures meaningful communication.
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shari4ov/event-driven-nodejs.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd event-driven-nodejs
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
